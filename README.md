## Extra Notes

### Background Task Handling (Celery Integration)

If the application needs to process large files, doing so within a standard HTTP request can lead to timeouts and poor user experience.

To handle such scenarios efficiently, we can integrate:

- Celery for background task processing

- Redis or RabbitMQ as the message broker

- Optional: Django Channels, WebSockets, or email notifications for user updates
